Technology has always presented numerous opportunities for improving and transforming healthcare.
 Such improvements include reducing human errors, improving clinical outcomes, facilitating care coordination, improving practice efficiencies, and tracking data over time.
 Machine learning (ML) has already proven effective at disease identification and prediction, recognizing patterns that are too subtle for the human eye to detect, guiding physicians towards better-targeted therapies and improved outcomes for patients. 
 Researchers have also used ML as a tool to recognize signs of depression and suicidality by assessing patients’ voices, picking up changes in speech too subtle for a doctor to notice. 
 Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can expand our approach to mental fitness.
